// Tim is visiting his grandma for two days and is bored due to the lack of the electricity over there. That's why he starts to play with grandma's colorful candle collection.

// He aligned the  candles from left to right. The th candle from the left has the height  and the color , an integer ranged from 1 to a given , the number of colors.

// Now he stares at the sequence of candles and wonders, how many strictly increasing ( in height ) colorful subsequences are there? A subsequence is considered as colorful if every of the  colors appears at least one times in the subsequence.

// As the number of subsequences fulfilling the requirement can be large, print the result modulo .

// Input Format

// On the first line you will be given  and , then  lines will follow. On the th line you will be given two integers  and .

// Constraints

// Output Format

// Print the number of strictly increasing colorful subsequences modulo .

// Sample Input

// 4 3
// 1 1
// 3 2
// 2 2
// 4 3
// Sample Output

// 2
// Explanation

// In the first sample the only two valid subsequences are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4).
